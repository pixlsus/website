		<h1>About PIXLS.US</h1>
		<p>
		There are many wonderful Free/Open Source Software projects dedicated to photography.
		Yet there aren&rsquo;t nearly as many resources dedicated to photographic workflows with them.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>
		This site hopes to rectify that with a simple goal:
		</p>
		<p id='mission'>
		<em>To provide tutorials, workflows and a showcase for high-quality photography using Free/Open Source Software.</em>
