It's that time of year again!  The weather is turning mild, the days are smelling fresh, and a bunch of photography nerds are all going to get together in a new country to roam around and (_possibly_) annoy locals by taking a _ton_ of photographs! It's the Pre-[_Libre Graphics Meeting_][lgm2016] photowalk of 2016!

[lgm2016]: http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/2016/

Come join us the day before LGM kicks off to have a stroll through a lovely park and get a chance to shoot some photos between making new friends and having a pint.

Thanks to the wonderful work by the local LGM organizing team, we are able to invite everyone out to the photowalk on **Thursday, April 14<sup>th</sup>** the day before LGM kicks off.

They were able to get us in touch with the kind folks at [Furtherfield Gallery & Commons][furtherfield] in Finsbury Park.  They've graciously offered us the use of their facilities at the Furtherfield Commons as a base to start from.  So we will meet at the Commons building at **10:00 on Thursday morning**.

If you would like to join us but may not make it to the Commons by 10:00, email me and let me know.  I'll try my best to make arrangements to meet up so you can join us a little later.  I can't imagine we'd be very far away (likely somewhere relatively near by in the park).

We'll plan on meandering through the park with frequent stops to shoot images that strike our fancy.  I will personally be bringing along my off-camera lighting equipment and a model (Mairi) to pose for us during the day.  In case anyone wanted to play/learn a little about that type of photography.

There is no set time for finishing up.  I figured we would play it by ear through lunch and to possibly all finish up at a nice pub together. (Taking advantage of the golden hour light at the end of the day hopefully).

In the spirit of saying "Thank you!" and sharing, I have also offered the Furtherfield folks our services for headshots and architectural/environmental shots of the Commons and Gallery spaces.  For sure I will be taking these images for them but if anyone else wanted to pitch in and try, help, or assist the effort would be very welcome!

Speaking of which, if you plan on attending and would like to explore some particular aspect of photography please feel free to let me know.  I'll do my best to match folks up based on interest.  I sincerely hope this will be a fun opportunity to learn some neat new things, make some new friends, and to maybe grab some great images at the same time!

If there are any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me!
