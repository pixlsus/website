This years [Libre Graphics Meeting (2017)][lgm] is going to be held in the lovely city seen above, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil!
This is an important meeting for so many people in the Free/Libre art community as it's one of the only times they have an opportunity to meet face to face.

We've had some folks attending the past LGM's ([Leipzig][] and [London][]) and it's a wonderful opportunity to spend some time with friends. (Also, [@frd][] from the community will be there!)

So in the spirit of camaraderie, I have a request...

## Donate

The [GIMP][] team will be in attendance this year.  I happen to have a fondness for them so I'm asking anyone reading this to please head over and [donate to the project][donate].

That link is for the GNOME PayPal account, but there are [other ways to donate][] as well.

This is one of the few times that the GIMP team gets a chance to meet in person.
They use the time to hack at GIMP and to manage internal business.
The time they get to spend together is invaluable to the project and by extension everyone that uses GIMP.

Just look at these faces!
Surely this [(Brady) Bunch][] of folks is worth helping to get a better GIMP?

## Attending

Besides [@frd][] I'm not sure who else from the community might be attending, so if I've missed you I apologize!
Please feel free to use this topic to communicate and coordinate if you'd like.

It appears that personally I'm on a biennial schedule with attending LGM - so I'm looking forward to next year to be able to catch up with everyone!
