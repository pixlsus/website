What a whirlwind trip!
This past week out in Saarbruecken was an _amazing_ trip filled with awesome people, presentations, and [perambulations][] (with cameras!).

[perambulations]: https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/perambulate "Yes I had to look this up so I could alliterate"


My first LGM was 2014/Leipzig so this was my 5<sup>th</sup> anniversary of attending the meeting!
It was actually there that I first had the idea for building what would eventually become PIXLS.US during conversations with Rolf Steinort (of [Meet the GIMP][] fame).

I also want to take a moment to acknowledge that my being able to attend is entirely due to the generosity and graciousness of the [GIMP][] team.
They are the best bunch of nerds someone could hope to be associated with and I'm looking forward to helping [Jehan][] get the GIMP extensions up and running this year to replace the old registry (more on that later)!

## The LGM Photowalk
This is the third year that I've been able to host and hang out with attendees on a photowalk ahead of the meeting.
This year we relied heavily on the knowledge of locals who are in the community like @houz and Ingo (@heckflosse) who scouted out locations near the venue that would make for an interesting stroll around town.
