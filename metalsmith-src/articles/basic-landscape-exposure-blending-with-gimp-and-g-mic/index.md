Photographer [Ian Hex] had previously explored the topic of exposure blending with us by [using luminosity masks in darktable](/articles/luminosity-masking-in-darktable/).
For his first *video* tutorial he's revisiting the subject entirely in [GIMP] and [G'MIC].

Have a look and let him know what you think in the forum.
He's promised more if he gets a good response from people - so let's give him some encouragement!
