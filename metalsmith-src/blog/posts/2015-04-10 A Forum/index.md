After much hard work, that basically consisted of me annoying darix as often as possible, I am glad to say that we finally have a [Discourse](http://discourse.org) instance set up!
**Super Big** thank you to darix for all the help!



## So What?
What does this mean?
For starters, we now have a forum/community in place that we can start building around photography and free software.

A neat side-effect of this forum is that we now also have a way to embed forum threads as comments on posts (only blogposts at the moment - I'll add them to articles shortly).

At the bottom of any blog post you should now either see a series of conversations happening with a `Continue Discussion` or a link to `Start Discussion`.
Either of those buttons will take you to the actual forum to continue the conversation.
Replies to topics that are tied to posts will show up as a conversation at the bottom of the post (check the bottom of this post).


The site is *open* and *live* at the moment (if a bit bare-bones).
Feel free to drop by and create an account, comment on things, start new topics, etc.
I'm testing things out at the moment to see if I need to possibly bump the server specs in order to handle the loads (most likely).
(In the course of writing this, I went ahead and bumped the server RAM to 2GB - so it should run smoothly).
