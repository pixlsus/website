I realize that I'm a little late to this, but photographer [João Almeida][joao] has created a wonderful set of film emulation presets for [darktable][] that he uses in his own workflow for personal and commisioned work. Even more wonderful is that he has graciously [released them for everyone to use][joao-emu].

<!-- more -->

These film emulations started as a personal side project for João, and he adds a disclaimer to them that he did not optimize them all for each brand or model of his cameras.  His end goal was for these to be as simple as possible by using a few [darktable][] modules. He describes it best on [his blog post about them][joao-emu]:

> The end goal of these presets is to be as simple as possible by using few Darktable modules, it works solely by manipulating Lab Tone Curves for color manipulation, black & white films rely heavily on Channel Mixer. Since I what I was aiming for was the color profiles of each film, other traits related with processing, lenses and others are unlikely to be implemented, this includes: grain, vignetting, light leaks, cross-processing, etc.

Some before/after samples from his blog post:
