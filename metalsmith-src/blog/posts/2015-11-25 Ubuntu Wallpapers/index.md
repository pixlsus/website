## darktable 2.0 RC2

Hot on the heels of the prior release candidate, [darktable][] now [has an RC2 out][rc2].
There are many minor bugfixes from the previous RC1, such as:

* high iso fix for exif data of some cameras
* various macintosh fixes (fullscreen)
* fixed a deadlock
* updated translations

The preliminary changelog from the 1.6.x series:

* darktable has been ported to gtk-3.0
* new thumbnail cache replaces mipmap cache (much improved speed, less crashiness)
* added print mode
* reworked screen color management (softproof, gamut check etc.)
* removed dependency on libraw
* removed dependency on libsquish (solves patent issues as a side effect)
* unbundled pugixml, osm-gps-map and colord-gtk
* text watermarks
* color reconstruction module
* raw black/white point module
* delete/trash feature
* addition to shadows&highlights
* more proper Kelvin temperature, fine-tuning preset interpolation in WB iop
* noiseprofiles are in external JSON file now
* monochrome raw demosaicing (not sure whether it will stay for release, like Deflicker, but hopefully it will stay)
* aspect ratios for crop&rotate can be added to conf (ae36f03)
* navigating lighttable with arrow keys and space/enter
* pdf export -- some changes might happen there still
* brush size/hardness/opacity have key accels
* the facebook login procedure is a little different now
* export can upscale
* we no longer drop history entries above the selected one when leaving dr or switching images
* text/font/color in watermarks
* image information now supports gps altitude
* allow adding tone- and basecurve nodes with ctrl-click
* new "mode" parameter in the export panel
* high quality export now downsamples before watermark and frame to guarantee consistent results
* lua scripts can now add UI elements to the lighttable view (buttons, sliders etc...)
* a new repository for external lua scripts was started.

More information and packages can be [found on the darktable github repository][rc2].

Remember, updating from the currently stable 1.6.x series is a one-way street for your edits (no downgrading from 2.0 back to 1.6.x).

All together now...

*Happy Birthday to GIMP!  Happy Birthday to GIMP!*...

This past weekend [GIMP][] celebrated it's 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary!
It was twenty years ago on November 21<sup>st</sup> that Peter Mattis [announced the availability][announce] of the **"General Image Manipulation Program"** on _comp.os.linux.development.apps_.

Twenty years later and GIMP doesn't look a day older than a 1.0 release!
(Yes, there's a [double entendre][] there).

To celebrate, I've been spending the past couple of months getting a brand new website and infrastructure built for the project!
<small>*Just in case anyone was wondering where I was or why I was so quiet.*</small>
I like the way it turned out and is shaping up so go have a look if you get a moment!

There's even an [official news post][20] about it on the new site!

### GIMP 2.8.16

To coincide with the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary, the team also released a new stable version in the 2.8 series: [2.8.16][getGIMP].
Head over to the downloads page to pick up a copy!!

## New PhotoFlow Tutorial

Still working hard and fast on [PhotoFlow][], [Andreas][Andrea Ferrero] took some time to record a new video tutorial.
He walks through some basic usage of the program, in particular opening an image, adding layers and layer masks, and saving the results.
Have a look and if you have a moment give him some feedback!

Andreas is working on PhotoFlow at a very fast pace, so expect some more news about his progress very soon!
