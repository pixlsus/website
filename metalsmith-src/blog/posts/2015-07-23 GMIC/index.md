Anyone who's followed me for a while likely knows that I'm friends with [G'MIC] (GREYC's Magic for Image Computing) creator [David Tschumperlé].
I was also able to release all of my film [emulation][] [presets][] on G'MIC for everyone to use with David's help and we collaborated on a bunch of different fun processing filters for photographers in G'MIC (split details/wavelet decompose, [freaky details], [film emulation], [mean/median averaging], and more).

It's also David that helped me by writing a G'MIC script to [mean average images] for me when I started making my amalgamations 
(Thus moving me away from my previous method of using [Imagemagick]):

So when the forums here on [discuss.pixls.us] were finally up and running, it only made sense to offer G'MIC its own part of the forums.
They had previously been using a combination of [Flickr groups] and [gimpchat.com].
These are great forums, they were just a little cumbersome to use.

**You can find the new [G'MIC category here](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/release-of-gmic-1-6-5-1/284).**
Stop in and say hello!

I'll also be porting over the tutorials and articles on work we've collaborated on soon (freaky details, film emulation).
