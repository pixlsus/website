Well, technically this isn't the first post on the site.
I had actually started with building out the temporary [Coming Soon](/) page.
Then I shifted focus on styling the main content page for the site (articles).
After a bit I realized that I should probably be working on some sort of blog posts as a means for folks to keep up with what I'm doing.

So, here we are!

## Who Am I?
**I'm [Pat David](http://blog.patdavid.net "Pat David's Blog").**

I'm an occasional photographer and I dabble in digital artwork occasionally as the mood strikes me.
I also happen to be a fan of free software. Those two worlds collide fairly often, and lately I've been having a great time writing about them.

I've been writing tutorials on my blog as well as trying to modernize/update tutorials on the [GIMP website](http://www.gimp.org "GIMP Website"). 
You could call me a <small>(small)</small> part of the GIMP team (but I'm trying to do more!).
I also try to help out where I can on other F/OSS projects as well ([G'MIC](http://gmic.sourceforge.net "G'MIC Homepage") is another place you'll find me bumming around).
I do these things because I think it's important to try and give back to the community in whatever way you're capable of.

**I'm loud.**  So I figured I could use that capability to help out.

<small>(It's my demented super-power).</small>

## So What's Going on Here?
Well, I mentioned on the main page that I felt like we could use a site/community dedicated to photography.  Particularly Free/Open Source Software and photography.

The problem I noticed is a lack of sites that focus explicitly on photography and workflows using F/OSS tools. 
There are plenty of blog posts on various sites, forum posts on various boards, and the occasional group on social media. 
There is _not_ a great website to act as a portal specifically for photographic needs or interests.

It's my sincere desire that I can build it.

_I actually find it strange to write that._ 
How does this not exist already?!

### Is It Ready Yet?

No.  Not quite.

I'm building this entire site from scratch, so it's taking a little bit of time.
I only just got the blog portion finished, so hopefully that much is done.

I've also _mostly_ finished what the main articles will look like.
I'm in the process of porting over some of my tutorials from my blog to here so that I can have some content to test things out with.
I enjoy doing this sort of thing, so it's a nice way to relax for me.

After that I'll just need to get a couple of other pages setup, and I should at least have the skeleton of the site up and running.
I promise, as soon as I have something to actually launch I will be loud and annoying about it.

### Can I Help?

That's the spirit!

Yes, absolutely. 
Just shoot me an email and I'll be happy to answer any questions I can. 
If there's some particular skill you'd like to bring, I'm all ears.
If you want to write an article or tutorial, let me know.
