I finally got off my butt to get a process in place to obtain and update security certificates using Let's Encrypt for both [pixls.us][] and [discuss.pixls.us][].
I also did some (*more*) work with [Victor Grigas][] and [Wikipedia][] to support their [#Edit2015][1] video this year.

## Wikipedia #Edit2015

Last year, I did some 2.5 parallax animations for Wikipedia to help with their first-ever [end-of-the-year retrospective video][edit2014] ([see the blog post from last year](http://blog.patdavid.net/2014/12/wikipedia-edit2014-video.html)).
Here is the retrospective from #Edit2014:

So it was an honor to hear from [Victor Grigas][] again this year!
This time around there was a neat new crop of images he wanted to animate for the video.
Below you'll find my contributions (they were all used in the final edit, just shortened to fit appropriately):

Victor chose some really neat images that were fun to work on!
Of course, all free software was used in this creation ([GIMP][] for cutting up the images into sections and rebuilding textures as needed and [Blender][] for re-assembling the planes and animating the camera movements).
I had previously [written a tutorial][] on doing this with free software on my blog.

## New Certificates

Yes, this is not very exciting I'll concede.
I think it _is_ important though.

I recently took advantage of my beta invite to [Let's Encrypt][LE].
It's a certificate authority that provides free X.509 certs for domain owners that was founded by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation][EFF], [Mozilla][Moz], and the [University of Michigan][UM].

[LE]: https://letsencrypt.org
[EFF]: https://www.eff.org/
[Moz]: www.mozilla.org
[UM]: https://www.umich.edu/

The key principles behind *Let's Encrypt* are:

  * __Free:__ Anyone who owns a domain name can use Let’s Encrypt to obtain a trusted certificate at zero cost.
  * __Automatic:__ Software running on a web server can interact with Let’s Encrypt to painlessly obtain a certificate, securely configure it for use, and automatically take care of renewal.
  * __Secure:__ Let’s Encrypt will serve as a platform for advancing TLS security best practices, both on the CA side and by helping site operators properly secure their servers.
  * __Transparent:__ All certificates issued or revoked will be publicly recorded and available for anyone to inspect.
  * __Open:__ The automatic issuance and renewal protocol will be published as an open standard that others can adopt.
  * __Cooperative:__ Much like the underlying Internet protocols themselves, Let’s Encrypt is a joint effort to benefit the community, beyond the control of any one organization.

It was relatively painless to obtain the certs.
I only had to run their program to use ACME to verify my domain ownership through placing a file on my web root.
Once the certs were generated I only had to make some small changes for it to work automatically on https://discuss.pixls.us.
(And to automatically get picked up when I update the certs within 90 days).

I still had to manually copy/paste the certs into cpanel for https://pixls.us, though.
Not automated (*or elegant*) but it works and only takes an extra moment to do.
