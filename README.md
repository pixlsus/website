PIXLS.US Website
================

Yep, here it is.  Finally!

**This is the Hugo migration for the old metalsmith website.**

Writing
-------
So you'd like to write some content for the site?  Awesome!

All of our files are written in [Markdown][] and are usually self-contained in a single directory for convenience.

I have started a guide to writing for the site that includes how to setup a preview environment easily and various small details about including images, videos, and more to be consistent with the site style and responsiveness.  You can find those details in the [WRITING.md][] file.

Building
--------


### Requirements

The site is built using a static site generator, [metalsmith][].

To build the site, you'll need:

* [Node.js][]  
    Currently,
    * `node --version` shows: `v4.4.4`.
    * `npm --version` is `2.15.1`  

Once you've installed Node.js, you can clone the site, then use Node Package Manager (npm)
to install the rest of the dependencies:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pixlsus/website.git
    $ cd website
    $ npm install

This command should install all of the required dependencies for building the site.
If you want to see exactly what they all are, take a look inside the [package.json][] file.


<del>There will likely be some warnings declared until I finish upgrading and testing packages.</del>  
The site has been updated to all of the latest packages.  Any residual WARNings are due to packages calling old(er) dependencies.




### Building the Site

Once the requirements are installed, the site can be built locally with:

    $ node index.js

This will output all of the site files into a directory, `build/`.

If you don't have an http server ready to use, you can install one:

    $ npm install -g http-server

and then start it up to view the built site:

    $ http-server build/

You can then see it in a browser: `localhost:8080`.
