PIXLS.US is a passion project.

We ❤️  the Free Software projects and all of the dedicated creators and users that make this such an amazing community!
Part of what we want to do is help spread the word about these awesome projects.

We also try to help by providing these projects with resources such as website design, hosting, and providing them [communities in the forums](https://discuss.pixls.us/software).  Some of the projects we love and work closely with include:

- [darktable](https://www.darktable.org)
- [digiKam](https://www.digikam.org)
- [GIMP](https:/www.gimp.org)
- [G'MIC](https://gmic.eu)
- [RawTherapee](https://www.rawtherapee.com)
- [Siril](https://siril.org)

If you are a Free Software photography/cinematography project that would like to off-load some work just reach out to us!
