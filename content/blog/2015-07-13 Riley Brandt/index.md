Photographer [Riley Brandt] recently released his [*Open Source Photography Course*].
I managed to get a little bit of his time to answer some questions for us about his photography and the course itself.
You can read the full interview [right here](/articles/a-q-a-with-photographer-riley-brandt/):

[**A Q&A with Photographer Riley Brandt**](/articles/a-q-a-with-photographer-riley-brandt/)

As an added bonus just for [PIXLS.US](//pixls.us) readers, he has gifted us a nice surprise!


## Did Someone Say Free Stuff?

Riley went above and beyond for us.
He has graciously offered us an opportunity for 2 readers to win a *free* copy of the course (one in an open format like WebM/VP8, and another in a popular format like MP4/H.264)!

<!-- more -->

For a chance to win, I'm asking you to share a link to this post on:
* [Twitter] 
* [Google+] 
* [Facebook] 

with the hashtag **#PIXLSGiveAway** (you can click those links to share to those networks).
Each social network counts as one entry, so you can triple your chances by posting across all three.

Next week (~~Monday, 2015-07-20~~ Wednesday, 2015-07-22 to give folks a full week), I will search those networks for all the posts and compile a list of people, from which I'll pick the winners (using random.org).
Make sure you get that hashtag right! :)



## Some Previews
Riley has released three nice preview videos to give a taste of what's in the courses:
