The [_Journal of the Photographic Society_][jps] is the journal for one of oldest photographic societies in the world: the [Royal Photographic Society][rps]. First published in 1853, the [_RPS Journal_][jps] is the oldest photographic periodical in the world (just edging out the [_British Journal of Photography_][bjp] by about a year).

So you can imagine my doubt when confronted with an email about using some material from [pixls.us](pixls.us) for their latest issue...

If the name sounds familiar to anyone it may be from a recent post by [Joe McNally][joemc] who is featured prominently in the September 2016 issue.  He [was also just inducted][joemcind] as a fellow into the society!

It turns out my initial doubts were completely unfounded, and they really wanted to run a page based off one of our tutorials.
The editors liked the [Open Source Portrait][osp] tutorial.  In particular, the section on using [_Wavelet Decompose_][wd] to touch up the skin tones:

How cool is that?  I actually searched the archive and the only other mention I can find of [GIMP][] (or any other F/OSS) is from a ["Step By Step" article written by Peter Gawthrop][gawthrop] (Vol. 149, February 2009).  I think it's pretty awesome that we can promote a little more exposure for Free Software alternatives.  Especially in more mainstream publications and to a broader audience!
