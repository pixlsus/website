On the old [RawTherapee][] forums they used to have a contest sharing a single raw file amongst the members to see how everyone would approach processing from the same starting point.  They called it **PlayRaw**.  This seemed to really bring out some great work from the community so I thought it might be fun to start doing something similar again here.

I took a (_relatively_) recent image of [Mairi][mairi-album] and decided to see how it would be received (I'd say fairly well given the responses).  This was my result from the raw file that I called [_Mairi Troisième_][mt]:

I made the raw file available under a [Creative Commons, By-Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share-Alike license][cc-by-sa-nc] so that anyone could freely download and process the file as they wanted to.

The only things I asked for was to see the results and possibly the processing steps through either an XMP or PP3 sidecar file ([darktable][] and [RawTherapee][] respectively).

[RawTherapee]: http://rawtherapee.com/

Here's a montage of the results from everyone:

I loved being able to see what everyone's approaches looked like.  It's neat to get a feel for all the different visions out there among the users and there were some truly beautiful results!

If you haven't given it a try yourself yet, head on over to the [\[PlayRaw] Mairi Troisieme][pr-mairi] thread to get the raw file and try it out yourself!  Just don't forget to show us _your_ results in the topic.

I'll be soliciting options for a new image to kick off another round of processing again soon.



## Speaking of Mairi

Don't forget that we still have a [Pledgie Campaign][] going on to help us offset the costs of getting everyone together at the [2016 Libre Graphics Meeting in London][lgm2016] this April!

Even better is if you're in the vicinity of London this April 15&ndash;18! Come out and join us as well as many other awesome Free Software projects all focused on the graphics community!  We (PIXLS) will be conducting photowalks and meet-ups the Thursday before LGM kicks off as well!

Oh, and I finally did convince Mairi to join us through the weekend to model for us as needed.  She's super awesome and worth raising a glass to/with!  Even more reason to come out and join us!
