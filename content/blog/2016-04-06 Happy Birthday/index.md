For some reason I was checking my account on the forums earlier today and noticed that it was created in April, 2015.  On further inspection it looks like my, and @darix, accounts were created on April 2<sup>nd</sup> 2015.

(Not to be confused with the main site because apparently it took me about 8 months to get a forum stood up...)

Which means that the forums have been around for just over a year now?!

So, **Happy Birthday** [discuss][]!

We're just over a year old and just under *500* users on the forum!

For fun, I looked for the oldest (public) post we had and it looks like it's the "[Welcome to PIXLS.US Discussion][welcome]" thread.  In case anyone wanted to revisit a classic...

**THANK YOU** so much to everyone who has made this an awesome place to be and nerd out about photography and software and more!  Since we started we migrated the official [G'MIC][] forums here as well as our friends at [RawTherapee][]!
We've been introduced to some awesome projects like [PhotoFlow][] as well as [Filmulator][].  And everyone has just been amazing, supportive, and fun to be around.
