It took a bit of digging and wrestling to get there, but a couple of nights ago I also managed to get an RSS feed working for the blog posts on the site.
Honestly, I spent more time fiddling with dates in javascript than I should have.

I had to make some minor modifications this morning to accommodate where the location should be, but it should be live now.

The location is: [http://pixls.us/blog/feed.xml](http://pixls.us/blog/feed.xml "Pixls.us blog RSS Feed").

Both the blog index pages and post pages contain a `<link>` element that point to it, so most readers *should* find the feed if you point it at a page.
I'll test it later, but the most important thing is the location is correct regardless of whatever hacking I do to the feed itself later.

<!--more-->

I've tested the feed quickly with [feedly](http://feedly.com "feedly.com") and it appears to be working ok. If anyone else is using other feed readers and sees a problem, please let me know!

I intend to have a separate feed available for the articles and main site content when I get those ready to go (most likely at http://pixls.us/articles/feed.xml).

## Social Media

I've also started (perhaps prematurely?) getting some social media accounts registered.
If for nothing else than to keep someone else from parking the accounts.

### Google+
At the moment, I've got a [Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/b/115344273324079495662/115344273324079495662/about "PIXLS.US Google+ Page") setup for the site.
I'll try to keep updates flowing to that page as well (so if you happen to use g+, follow it!).
If you already [follow me](http://plus.google.com/+PatrickDavid "Pat David on Google+") on g+ then you'll know I'm fairly active there.

Now if I could just get google to allow my vanity URL to *only* read +pixlus I'd be a happy camper!

### Twitter
Back when I first registered this domain name, I apparently had the foresight to register a [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com "twitter.com") handle as well.
So if you want to follow the conversation there, you can find me [@pixlsus](https://twitter.com/pixlsus "Pixls.us Twitter Account").
I even found a first tweet back from Dec 2011!

### Flickr
I've also created a [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com "flickr.com") group for users on Flickr to share photos or congregate.
You can find the group [here](https://www.flickr.com/groups/pixlsus/ "Pixls.us Flickr Group").

Really this is just a pre-emptive action to have these channels available as soon as we get going.


## Moving Along
I feel like I'm gaining a little traction here.
There's a few more things I need to tidy up and make some design decisions on, but at least I have a clear vision going forward.
I've already got an article ported over from [Getting Around in GIMP](http://blog.patdavid.net/p/getting-around-in-gimp.html "Getting Around in GIMP") on my blog to use as a test case for formatting.

As soon as I like how it's looking, I'll work on porting over some other articles as well.
If it goes well, I may just go ahead and update/re-write some more things as well to test with.
As soon as I have things in a relatively stable state I'll also get some new material out as well!
