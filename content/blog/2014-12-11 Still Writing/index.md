It's been a busy month (+ &frac12;) for me personally.
Things have finally settled down so I can get back to writing articles and working on the site.


## Wavelets Coming

As I mentioned in the [previous post](/blog/2014/10/iterating/), I'm currently working through a re-write of the various tutorials I had done about using Wavelet Decompose for skin retouching.
I'm about <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the way through it now and expect to have it finished shortly.

## Guest Writer Ian Hex

I also previously mentioned that I've been reaching out to a few folks to see if they might be interested in writing some articles for the site.
I'm *extremely* pleased to say that [Ian Hex](https://plus.google.com/+IanHex/about) is stepping up to the plate with a neat tutorial about [darktable](http://www.darktable.org/) that is being written right at this very moment!

If you haven't had a chance to see Ian's work I highly recommend stopping by his site at http://lightsweep.co.uk/ to get a gander at some epic images from the UK.
I desperately want to hop on a plane and visit after seeing them!

His self-professed mission is:

> ..to show off the beauty of British landscapes and architecture to the world

and I'd say he's doing a bang-up job of it so far!

Ian will be writing about Luminosity Masks in darktable.
Given his results and body of work I am personally looking forward to this one!

Maybe if we get a good enough response with his post we can convince him to come back and write some more...
