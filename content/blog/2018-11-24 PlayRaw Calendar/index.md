Last year I got an amazing surprise in the mail.
It was an _awesome_ calendar of a handpicked selection of results from the years [PlayRaw][] images.

Chris (@chris) put together another fantastic calendar for this year (while juggling kids, too) and it's too nice to not have a post about it!

It was a really awesome surprise to recieve my calendar last year - and I wish I would have planned a little better to be able to grab a photo of the calendar hanging in my office \(it's my work desk calendar - it never fails to remind me that there's more fun things to life than work - also that I need to up my processing game... ).

This year Chris has done it again by assembling a wonderfully curated collection of images and edits from the various Play Raws that were posted this year.
I've plagiarized [his post on the forums](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/playraw-calendar-2019/) to put together this post and get some more publicity for his time and effort!

If you get a moment, please thank Chris for his work putting this together!

Here are the images he chose for the calendar and the edits he included:

These [Play Raws][PlayRaw] are a ton of fun and one of the great aspects of having such a generous community to share the images and allowing everyone to practice and play.
I am constantly humbled by the amazing work our community produces and _shares with everyone_.

**Thank you** to everyone who shared image and participated in processing (and sharing how you achieved your results)!  I have really learned some neat things based on others work and look forward to even more opportunities to play (pun intended).

_Fun side note:_ the Play Raws are actually something that began on the old [RawTherapee][] forums.  When they moved their official forums here with us it was one of those awesome things I'm glad they brought over with them (the people were pretty great too... :)).
